Type-C is becoming increasingly common across new computers, laptops, and even servers. After testing many manufacturers, we found one that could produce this stylish orange Type-C cable with a lovely silicone feel that meets our quality standards.</p> <p>Currently, an extra Type-C-to-USB-A adapter is required if our Mini-KVM works with a host computer that only has USB-A ports.</p> <p></p> <p>We know it\u2019s a bit of a hassle, so we\u2019re working closely with our manufacturer to improve it by integrating an attached Type-C-to-USB-A adapter.

We\u2019re aiming to include this solution in our final toolkit package for backers, but I'm still crunching the numbers and giving my calculator a workout! To make this happen, we need more support to reduce the overall cost of production for our mini-KVM toolkit. Given the current crowdfunding numbers and production costs, making this custom Type-C cable is becoming more feasible, as it is approaching the break-even point. I\u2019ll keep everyone updated in the Openterface community on any progress!</p> <p>For your part, if you find our project promising and believe the Mini-KVM can make your tech life easier, please consider backing us and spreading the word to your friends.
